# Mini FPGA Projects Collection 🛠️

Welcome to my personal collection of mini FPGA-based projects! This repository contains a growing set of simple yet functional digital design modules built with Verilog/SystemVerilog. Each project includes synthesisable design files and corresponding testbenches to verify functionality.

## 🔧 Projects Included

### ✅ Completed Projects
- **ALU**  
  A basic Arithmetic and Logic Unit supporting essential operations.

- **Barrel Shifter**  
  Implements logical and rotational shift operations for variable distances.

- **LED Blink**  
  Simple LED blinker using counters and clock division.

- **Integrated Up-Down Counter**  
  A binary counter module with control for both up and down counting.

> 📹 Each project is verified in simulation and also tested on hardware. Relevant videos and photos demonstrating working conditions are included.

## 📁 Project Structure
Each project folder typically contains:
- `design.v` – Synthesisable Verilog/SystemVerilog source
- `tb.v` – Testbench for simulation
- `docs/` – (Optional) Images or video links showing the working hardware

## 🚀 Upcoming Additions
This repo is a work in progress. I will continue adding more mini projects over time. Stay tuned !

## 💡 About
These projects are part of my learning and exploration with FPGA design, targeted mainly at development boards like [Nexys Artix-7 100T FPGA board] Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or fork for your own use!
